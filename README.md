# WebClient
This is intended to be a universal front end for testing out the different blockchain platforms which will be interfaced by a generic API for each.

In order to run this client, do the following:

 - Install npm
 - Type npm install
 
It is worth noting that this client will not display anything unless you are running some kind of blockchain in the background. Check the other repos here for examples of chains you can run that will work with this Web Client.
